# Ping Pong a browser video game mod

Just a simple JavaScript project to test WebAPI canvas. WebAPI has relatively high performance, due to GPU acceleration, but doesn't support any complex image processing available in DirectX or OpenGL, like: shadows, lights, diffuse lights, texture processing and e.t.c.

The project is completely built based on the OOP principles described in ECMAScript6 standards. App code is structured into classes. Their objects are created based on inheritance, associations, compositions,  aggregations. App is hard-coded in conjunction with its HTML/CSS view and can't be exported to other web projects. Entry point is:

```javascript
const game = new Game();
```
